Image Filtering for Canny Edge Detection


This was a assignment for my Robot Vision course, so that's why the sections of the code are segmented by "Question "
as each section pertained to a question in the assignment doc which is not posted here since it is not mine to post, and
I also do not want people googling things from the doc, happening upon this branch, and copying my hard-earned code.

Although this branch says this is a canny edge detector, it is much more. It also demonstrates box filtering, median filtering, gaussian filtering,
sobel filtering, and image segementation, and a custom histogram generator.
